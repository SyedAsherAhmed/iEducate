      <p class="text-big"> Importance Of Education </p>
      <p class="text-small mt-1"> Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge,
        skills,
        values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion
        and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can
        also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a
        formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of
        teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

      <p class="text-big"> History Of Education </p>
      <p class="text-small mt-1"> Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills
        deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation.
        Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend
        their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed.
        Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.</p>
